## 10 Scrum Terms
##### In this Document i will be explaining 10 different Scrum Terms Which i will be using though out my time using it. 
#### 1 - Burndown Charts 
###### Burndown charts show work remaining over time. Work remaining is the Y axis and time is the X axis. The work remaining should jig up and down and eventually trend downward. 
###### The Scrum books define a sprint burndown chart as a place to see daily progress, and a product burndown chart as where to show monthly (per sprint) progress.
#### 2 - Scrum Roles
###### There are three essential roles in any Scrum project:
###### Product Owner
###### ScrumMaster
###### Team
#### 3 - Sprint
###### An iteration of work during which an increment of product functionality is implemented. By the book, an iteration lasts 30 days. This is longer than in other agile methods to take into account the fact that a functional increment of product must be produced each sprint.

###### The Sprint starts with a one-day sprint planning meeting. Many daily Scrum meetings occur during the sprint (one per day). At the end of the sprint we have a sprint review meeting, followed by a sprint retrospective meeting.

###### During the sprint, the team must not be interrupted with additional requests. Guaranteeing the team won't be interrupted allows it to make real commitments it can be expected to keep
