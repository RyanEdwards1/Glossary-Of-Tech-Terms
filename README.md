## 10 Scrum Terms
##### In this Document i will be explaining 10 different Scrum Terms Which i will be using though out my time using it. 
#### 1 - Burndown Charts 
###### Burndown charts show work remaining over time. Work remaining is the Y axis and time is the X axis. The work remaining should jig up and down and eventually trend downward. 
###### The Scrum books define a sprint burndown chart as a place to see daily progress, and a product burndown chart as where to show monthly (per sprint) progress.
#### 2 - Scrum Roles
###### There are three essential roles in any Scrum project:
###### Product Owner
###### ScrumMaster
###### Team
#### 3 - Sprint
###### An iteration of work during which an increment of product functionality is implemented. By the book, an iteration lasts 30 days. This is longer than in other agile methods to take into account the fact that a functional increment of product must be produced each sprint.

###### The Sprint starts with a one-day sprint planning meeting. Many daily Scrum meetings occur during the sprint (one per day). At the end of the sprint we have a sprint review meeting, followed by a sprint retrospective meeting.

###### During the sprint, the team must not be interrupted with additional requests. Guaranteeing the team won't be interrupted allows it to make real commitments it can be expected to keep.
#### 4 - Product Backlog
###### The product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog Items. These included both functional and non-functional customer requirements, as well as technical team-generated requirements. While there are multiple inputs to the product backlog, it is the sole responsibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog.
#### 5 - Impediments
###### Anything that prevents a team member from performing work as efficiently as possible is an impediment. Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. ScrumMasters often arrange sidebar meetings when impediments cannot be resolved on the spot in the daily Scrum meeting.
#### 6 - Done 
###### Done Also Referred to as "Done" or "Done Done" this term is used to describe a product increment that is considered releasable; it means that all design, coding, testing and documentation have been completed and the increment is fully integrated.
#### 7 - Epic 
###### A very large user story that is eventually broken down into smaller stories; epics are often used as placeholders for new ideas that have not been thought out fully. Theres nothing wrong with having an epic, as long as it is not high priority.
#### 8 - Velocity
###### An optional, but often used, indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.
#### 9 - Stakeholder
###### A person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Represented by the Product Owner and actively engaged with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.
#### 10 - Product Owner
###### The role in Scrum accountable for maximizing the value of a product, primarily by incrementally managing and expressing business and functional expectations for a product to the Development Team(s).

### 11 - Programming Steps

#### 11. 1. Clarify/Define What language and IDE you will use 

###### Firstly you will want to define what language you will use to write this set project in. Then you will need to find a IDE that supports the Language you have chosen

#### 11. 2. Design the Program
###### This is where you create the story boards of how what ever you are making is going to play out. secondly you will need to make a flow chart of how the code will work so that you can follow it. Then if you need any graphics or assets you will need to design or buy them as well

#### 11. 3. Code the Program
###### This is where you will need to have your IDE selected because you will be starting to code your work and you are going to want to make sure it is compatible with your customers needs. 

### 11. 4. Test the Program
##### At this point your code should be complete enough to be able to test cetain parts of the code or even all of it. This is the start of the debugging process. 
### 11. 5. Document and Maintain
##### Once you have completed your work you will send it off to the customer and you will maintain it if it is a website or a app. 

#### 12 - Algorithms 
###### An algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem. Algorithms need to have their steps in the right order as they are followed by any one and everyone so if they are in the wrong order it is like looking a instructions the wrong way. A example of this is a Flow Chart.
#### 13 - IDE
###### A IDE also known as a Integrated Development Environment. Is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some Examples of this are NotePad ++, Repl.It, Shell And Unity

#### 14 - Debugging 
###### Debugging is a process that is very helpful and useful for every coder it helps you look over your working code in the console and check to see if there is any errors have occured in the process. Then you are able to read and check through every line in the code that has been affected the program. This then makes sure the program is in working order and to make it more robust. Without this, the code affect might not be shown and so you will not be able to know what is the problem with the code. Which may then cause problems in the future.
