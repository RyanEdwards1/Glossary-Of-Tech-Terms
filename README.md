## 10 Scrum Terms
##### In this Document i will be explaining 10 different Scrum Terms Which i will be using though out my time using it. 
#### 1 - Burndown Charts 
###### Burndown charts show work remaining over time. Work remaining is the Y axis and time is the X axis. The work remaining should jig up and down and eventually trend downward. 
###### The Scrum books define a sprint burndown chart as a place to see daily progress, and a product burndown chart as where to show monthly (per sprint) progress.
#### 2 - Scrum Roles
###### There are three essential roles in any Scrum project:
###### Product Owner
###### ScrumMaster
###### Team
#### 3 - Sprint
###### An iteration of work during which an increment of product functionality is implemented. By the book, an iteration lasts 30 days. This is longer than in other agile methods to take into account the fact that a functional increment of product must be produced each sprint.

###### The Sprint starts with a one-day sprint planning meeting. Many daily Scrum meetings occur during the sprint (one per day). At the end of the sprint we have a sprint review meeting, followed by a sprint retrospective meeting.

###### During the sprint, the team must not be interrupted with additional requests. Guaranteeing the team won't be interrupted allows it to make real commitments it can be expected to keep.
#### 4 - Product Backlog
###### The product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog Items. These included both functional and non-functional customer requirements, as well as technical team-generated requirements. While there are multiple inputs to the product backlog, it is the sole responsibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog.
#### 5 - Impediments
###### Anything that prevents a team member from performing work as efficiently as possible is an impediment. Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. ScrumMasters often arrange sidebar meetings when impediments cannot be resolved on the spot in the daily Scrum meeting.
#### 6 - Done 
###### Done Also Referred to as "Done" or "Done Done" this term is used to describe a product increment that is considered releasable; it means that all design, coding, testing and documentation have been completed and the increment is fully integrated.
#### 7 - Epic 
###### A very large user story that is eventually broken down into smaller stories; epics are often used as placeholders for new ideas that have not been thought out fully. Theres nothing wrong with having an epic, as long as it is not high priority.
#### 8 - Velocity
###### An optional, but often used, indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.
#### 9 - Stakeholder
###### A person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Represented by the Product Owner and actively engaged with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.
#### 10 - Product Owner
###### The role in Scrum accountable for maximizing the value of a product, primarily by incrementally managing and expressing business and functional expectations for a product to the Development Team(s).

### 11 - Programming Steps / Building an Application

#### 11. 1. Meeting The Client:
###### The first thing that you will do will be meeting with the client that has hired you to undertake the task. From the initial meeting they will pitch their idea or proposal to you and you will take notes whilst also throwing ideas and questions their way to gain a better understanding. This is where the client will tell you the requirements of the project. Which you will need to take down as the most important thing because if you don’t meet all the requirements you are wasting your time. Before you start designing the project you will need to break down the requirements and put them into Epics and User Stories so that they are easier to follow and you can create milestones.

#### 11. 2. Design the Program
###### This is where you will create the story boards of how the project you are making is going to play out it will also help you in the coding as well with milestones. Secondly you will need to make a flow chart of how the code will work so that you can follow it. Then if you need any graphics or assets you will need to design or buy them as well

#### 11. 3. Clarify/Define What language
###### Firstly you will want to define what language you will use to write your project in each language is different so it is important you select the right one for your selected project. It is important to make sure you chose the correct language for your project as multiple people can be working on this project so you will need to check with them to see what languages they are able to code in 

#### 11. 4. Code the Program
###### This is where you will need to have your IDE selected because you will be starting to code your work and you are going to want to make sure it is compatible with your customers needs. You will make sure at this stage that everything you plan to do is right for the clients needs. Using your Story boards and flow chart you will then begin to program the code following the steps 

#### 11. 5. Test the Program
###### At this point your code should be complete enough to be able to test cetain parts of the code or even all of it. This is the start of the debugging process. If you have selected a IDE that supports alot of debugging tools then this step can be made easier then. the IDE will point out mistakes and problems with your code which you are albe to fix straight away. if your IDE does not support debugging features then you will need to find alternate ways to troubleshoot the code. This can be done by running the code as intended e.g. opening it in a browser or even in a third party software/program to see if the correct features load.

#### 11. 6. Document and Maintain
###### Once you have completed your work you will send it off to the customer and you will maintain it if it is a website or a app. The documentation will also help to provide evidence to the client to show how hard or how long you spent working on the project.

#### 11. 7.Shipping/Hand over
###### once the project is complete and you are happy with your work then it is stime to hand it over to the client and make sure that they are also happy with the finished final project. If they are then the exchange happens

#### 11. 8. - Compiler 
###### The way a compiler works is that it scan the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. Ready for it to run. The problem with this is that it takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. Some examples of languages that use a Compiler is C or C++. Another problem with a comiler is that it generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.

#### 11. 9. Interpreter
###### A Interpreter runs in a very differnet way to a compiler. The way a interpreter works is that it will follow your code line by line translating one statement at a time. Some examples of programmning langauges that use a interpreter is Python and Ruby. A interpreter takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. A benift of using a interpreter is that it continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops this makes debugging easy as you know where error will have occurred.

#### 12 - Definition Of Algorithms 
###### An algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem. Algorithms need to have their steps in the right order as they are followed by any one and everyone so if they are in the wrong order it is like looking a instructions the wrong way. A example of this is a Flow Chart. The algorithms normally have a set of operations which all include computer programs waiting to be executed

#### Implementation of an Algorithm 
###### An algorithm is a list of simple rules that the computer will execute and follow step by step till it is complete. For an algorithm to work you need to follow the steps in which you want the application to run. An example of this is when you first get a new project you will break it down into steps and then you will create a flowchart with the outcome. The flow chart will then help you to start writing your code. The flow chart also gives you mile stones while you go keeping you in the correct path.  


#### 13 - IDE
###### A IDE also known as a Integrated Development Environment.  Is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some Examples of this are NotePad ++, Repl.It, Shell And Unity

#### Features of Repl.it (IDE)
###### The main features of Repl.it is that it is a live real time up to date running system of the code that you input on the left-hand side of the screen. Also, it allows you to access your work anywhere you want if you have an internet connection as it saves your work to their servers. Also, if you have an account with them you can save a lot of work and access it anywhere. It also helps with your coding standards like indenting your code and it also has a colour scheme for certain standards to help. Another feature is help with debugging when there is an error it displays the line that it is on or is causing the error so the programmer knows where to look.    

#### 13.1 Using a IDE vs Not Using a IDE
###### In project 1 we used Notepad to create are Trace ball. Note pad is not a IDE so it had nothing to support the coder you could only see the text that you have written and then run it once you save it. Also when you want to run it, it will launch in a web browser which can cause problems sometimes when using Internet Explorer. But you may not have any problems lanching it in Chrome.  
###### In project 2 we used Repl.It which was a real time IDE which allowed us to see are code on the other side of the screen when ever we clicked run it would happen straight away. it also helped with Indenting and other coding benefits. Also once you have finished your program it allows you to download it straight to your PC or even upload it to your GitHub

#### Common Features Of An IDE

#### 14 - Debugging 
##### Definition 
###### Debugging is a process that is very helpful and useful for every coder it helps you look over your working code in the console and check to see if there are any errors have occurred in the process. Then you are able to read and check through every line in the code that has been affected the program. This then makes sure the program is in working order and to make it more robust. Without this, the code affect might not be shown and so you will not be able to know what is the problem with the code. Which may then cause problems in the future
##### Different tools in debugging 
###### The Tools of Debugging, firstly what is a debugging tool, it is a computer code introduced to a computer program to test for errors or to help determine the cause of an error. It can be as simple as an echo command to print the value of a variable at certain points of a program. they are used by every single programmer to get rid of any errors in their code once they are done with their work. the most common tool is DDD which is used in GBD, jdb, Python, Perl and Tcl. People also use Interactive debugging, Print debugging and Tracing debugging

#### Common Features In IDEs For Debugging:
###### Breakpoints - A Breakpoint is an stopping or pausing place in a program if it is to run into a problem
###### Step Into - Executes code one statement at a time
###### Step Out - Executes the remaining lines of a function in which the current execution point lies
###### Run to cursor - This command starts debugging and sets a temporary breakpoint on the current line of code.
###### Examine an exception - When your app throws an exception, the debugger takes you to the line of code that threw the exception

##### Different techniques in debugging
###### Interactive debugging, Print / Tracing debugging, Remote debugging, Post-mortem debugging and Delta Debugging
##### Backtracking
###### One debugging idea is to start debugging from the point where the problem occurred and go back through the code till you find where the code has gone wrong do this all the way back to the start 
##### Debugging Process 
###### 1. Reproduce the problem. 

###### 2. Describe the bug. Try to get as much input from the user to get the exact reason.

###### 3. Capture the program snapshot when the bug appears. Try to get all the variable values and states of the program at that time.

###### 4. Analyse the snapshot based on the state and action. Based on that try to find the cause of the bug. 

###### 5. Fix the existing bug, but also check that any new bug does not occur.

##### Secure and Robust
###### Debugging makes your work more Secure and Robust, the debugging process can be used to help develop more secure, robust applications, though to first understand how, it is required to first know what the robustness of a system is, which in this instance robustness relates to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input.


#### 15 - Procedural 
###### Procedures also known as functions contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. 

#### 16 - Object Orientated 
###### Based on the concept of 'Objects', which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. OOP features object's that can access and modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. OOP programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one and other.

#### 17 - Event Driven Pradigms 
###### The flow of the program is controlled by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads. Some examples are Buttons, Mouse movement, Yes or No and a switch

#### 18 - Relationship Between paradigms 
###### All of the paradigms are trying to acheive the same outcome but in all different ways. They are all trying to do the same thing which is to help implement some form of solution to the problem that the user is having, the differences are how they do it. They all contain functions but have different ways of them being implemented. Procedural simply just calls the functions, Event Driven ties the function to an event to happen and Object Orientated ties the function to an object through class and other methods.

### Security

#### 19 - Threats That An Organisation Would Face
###### One of the most common threats faced by organization is employees with a negative approach. This can cause the production of company to move slower. Another threat security issues pose a major threat to the organization with trojan horse, Brute force and welcome in are all ways hackers try to get into organizations 

#### 20 - Security Procedure for a company 
###### The company that i have choosen to talk about is Steam a online platform for video games. It has many different security procedures as people spend alot of money on games and there accounts can contain bank details. There main security feature is the two-factor authentication. The way it works is when you try to log in, it sends a message to the users phone with a code which you have to enter to be able to log in. You can also back up your details with your email so if some wants to change your password then it will email you first. Another security feature they have is for younger people on the platform of Parental Control which limits which games they can buy, which friends they can add. They also regularly remind you to never share your passwords

#### 21 - Building an Application 
###### The first thing to do when building an application is to understand the aims and objectives that have been set by either the client or your audience. Once you have set them out you want to make them into User stories and if you are in a group then you want to spread them out to your team. But if you are by yourself you have to manage your time. You then want to be able to choose the best IDE that suits your application. Then the coding begins once you have finished the coding you want to run your final tests and then you ship it off to your customer if they are happy with it 

### Research

#### 22 - Qualitative
###### Qualitative Research is primarily exploratory research. It is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. Qualitative data collection methods vary using unstructured or semi-structured techniques. Some common methods include focus groups, individual interviews, and participation/observations

#### 23 - Quantitative
###### Quantitative Research is used to quantify the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics. It is used to quantify attitudes, opinions, behaviors, and other defined variables. Quantitative data collection methods include various forms of surveys – online surveys, paper surveys, mobile surveys and kiosk surveys, face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, longitudinal studies, website interceptors, online polls

#### 24 - How technical solutions can be compared
###### How Technical solutions are compared in many different ways and for many different reasons. They are mainly compared to see which one best suits the systems purpose in order to best complete the project. When looking for different solutions you have to look at its safety to keep your project safe from hackers or malicious software. Also you have to look for security which will also keep your work safe and protect it. You also want the solution to be reliable so that when you need to do work it is up and running and has no down time. When using these solutions, you also want to be able to maintain your work and project so maintainability is important to the developers as well. The solution also needs to be user friendly for the project team it needs to be something everyone can use. So normally the solutions can be edited so the manager can select a certain programming language for example. Overall the people using these solutions are looking for a trust worthy technical solution 

### Explain User and Software Requirements
###### The software requirements are what is given to you by the client. When you first meet them they will do a presentation or give you information on what they want in the product. They will give you a brief of the project it will be your job to break it down and create Epic Stories which you will use as your mile stones when designing and programming it you will have to implement these stories. You will also break down User Stories which can be used to make smaller stories to follow while you work and also they can help for debugging.  There are also many other software requirements which need to be addressed such as Purpose, System Overview, 

###### Epic Stories is a large body of work that are normally addressed as milestones for most programmers. Which they may meet over time by completing smaller tasks.

###### User Stories are a smaller amount of work than an Epic Story these User Stories can also be known as tasks which can be completed within a day or two. There is normally a certain number of User Stories in side of an Epic Story

###### Purpose, the purpose of the project is always at the top of the document and will be a description of the whole project and what the outcome should be this is before it is broken down into stories.

###### Overview is down when a mile stone is complete or when the project is complete and you are doing final checks and debugging.
